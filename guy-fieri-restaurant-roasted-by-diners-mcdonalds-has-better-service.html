is worse than at McDonald’s.</p><p>The 55-year-old celebrity chef — who is estimated to be worth $197 million — opened his first restaurant in Santa Rosa, California, in 1996 with Johnny Garlic’s, a pasta restaurant.</p><p>Now, he has restaurants across America, including a delivery-only eatery called Guy Fieri’s Flavortown Kitchen.</p><p>But his Las Vegas restaurant, Guy Fieri’s Vegas Kitchen, is being bashed by patrons for its bad service — with one even claiming that a fast food chain “has better service.”</p><p>Another claimed they were greeted with a “cold shoulder” and seated with a “disgusting attitude.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Guy Fieri opened his first restaurant in Santa Rosa, California, in 1996 with Johnny Garlic’s, a pasta

Not a hello, ignoring any questions we had for him,” they wrote.</p><p>The review continued, “I mentioned to him, with his lack of empathy, you work in hospitality and you’re being hostile, if you don’t want us to dine at your establishment then please ask us to leave. I won’t allow you to ever treat me or anyone that travel across the world to dine here feel unwelcome. Total disappointment and shame to such a great brand.”</p><p>Despite the rudeness from the host, the diner said that their waiter turned their experience around.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">A customer claimed they were greeted with a “cold shoulder” and seated with a “disgusting attitude.” <span class=credit>Jam Press</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The restaurant responded to the review, writing, “Thank you for your review. We are happy you enjoyed Jonathan’s service. He will be recognized for his efforts.” <span class=credit>Jam Press</span></figure><p>“The food was great and I should compliment Johnathan, our server for turning our complaint and made it a compliment because of his enthusiasm and professionalism, he carried the team that day. Thank you sir, but the host [name removed], is more than welcome to find work elsewhere if he doesn’t like his job,” they wrote.</p><p>The restaurant responded to the review, writing, “Thank you for your review. We are happy you enjoyed Jonathan’s service. He will be recognized for his efforts” — but did not acknowledge the negative aspects.</p><p>Another diner shared that she went with a party of 10 for a friend’s birthday, explaining, “People made reservations, and understood it was very busy. As for poor quality customer service, I’ll go to McDonald’s for that.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">“This place is amazing. I got the mac and cheese burger and it was the best thing to ever touch my lips. The trash can nachos were incredible. Hands down, best meal of my life,” someone wrote. <span class=credit>Jam Press</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The restaurant was likely overjoyed to see the positive review and thanked the reviewer for his kind words. <span class=credit>Jam Press</span></figure><p>“I can keep going on and on about how unhappy we were. Even the management, Armando, wasn’t really helpful. It’s sad as a local this is my first time here and I was not pleased. The food was good but cold,” she continued.</p><p>Some commented on the food, saying that it was “bland” and dry.”</p><p>“Disappointing. Guy spends so much time going around the country praising folks for their great scratch cooking. Yet at his own place the food was bland, dry and possibly even processed frozen food,” one customer lamented.</p><p>“I had the reuben which was dry and the chicken sandwich, which we could’ve sworn was a frozen breast. It needed seasoning as it was very bland. They went and got good bread but everything else was average at best. We tried it, and will not be going back. With his brand we expected so much more.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">One diner shared that she went with a party of 10 for a friend’s birthday, explaining, “People made reservations, and understood it was very busy.
