The players are almost instantly exiled to the wilderness below it, where they will have to make do on nearly nothing, as opposed to living it up in a luxurious villa on a clifftop overlooking the ocean. The turn? The participants can alter their position in the game and return to the resort to compete for a life-changing cash reward if they can out-plan and out-strategize their rivals.</p><p>But nobody is ever safe in this kind of competitive gaming because one minute you’re living it up and the next you’re down to the fundamentals.</p><p>Twelve candidates think they’re going to spend the summer in luxury at a gorgeous estate. However, they will have to start from scratch and eke out an existence in the woods without any luxuries before they can pop any bottles. The players living in the wilderness, also known as the “outsiders,” will have numerous opportunities to come back to the villa, where they will eventually become “insiders.”</p><p>Outsiders can be voted back into the resort, where they will take an insider’s position and have the opportunity to fight for the cash prize if they succeed in challenges and forge powerful enough coalitions.</p><p>The contestants will fight their way into the villa for a chance to win the $100,000 grand prize.</p><p>Shea Foster, Aaron Blake, Copan Combs, Francisco Williams, Hayley Smith-Rose, Sarah Kate Reynolds, Justin Assada, Lellies Santiago, Taylor Olympios, Alex Dourassof, Linda Okoli, and Tabitha Kimberly Eva are the cast members competing for the cash prize.</p><p>In September 2023, Copan took to Instagram and wrote: “Y’all ready to see if I survived paradise?

He has been working in that role for 6 years.</p><p>He sometimes feels like a parent when he sees one of his students starting college. But, rather than 18 years, he only gets to know them for a little over a year. Senior admissions advisor Copan works for Oklahoma State University. He serves as many students’ and their families’ introduction to OSU.</p><p>Copan is constantly wearing America’s Brightest Orange, from his orange blazer all the way down to his orange shoes, whether he is visiting high schools in his region, which includes southwest Oklahoma and North Texas, or extending a warm welcome to prospective students during their visit to OSU. OSU has 25 admissions advisors who serve both the domestic and international markets.</p><p>Some have their headquarters there, such as Combs. There are counselors who reside in and establish ties with the cities where OSU enrolls a significant number of students, including the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, Tulsa, and Oklahoma City.</p><p>Copan is aware of the significance of his work. Additionally, he doesn’t only focus on recruiting; he also assists parents in understanding their possibilities for scholarships and financial aid and responds to any inquiries they may have about OSU or the college decision process.</p><p>“We have passion for a lot of things,” Copan said. “Obviously we’re passionate about OSU, but we’re proud to help out in general. There are so many things. If we don’t know an answer, we connect future students to someone on campus who does. For example, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is confusing for a lot of people and we connect them with our Scholarships and Financial Aid Office team to help.”</p><p>He earned his degree in marketing and sports management, but after interning with OSU Athletics, he realized he wasn’t meant to be in the background. He wanted to be out meeting people and telling them about OSU.</p><p>The Oklahoma State University admissions counselor appeared on Season 14 of the Food Network cooking competition “Worst Cooks in America” which premiered in August 2018. A reality competition doesn’t seem like much of a leap, but a food program does, according to people who know him.</p><h3><strong>Is Copan Combs Dating Anyone?</strong></h3><p>Copan Combs is most likely single.
