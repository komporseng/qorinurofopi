Her Age, Net Worth, Renovation 911</h1><div id=sub-header>May 2024 · 5 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p>Following the success of the HGTV series Renovation, Inc and Renovation Island, Renovation 911 premiered on 28 March 2023 and introduced to viewers a dynamic sisters pair Lindsey Uselding and <a href=#>Kirsten Meehan</a>.</p><p>In this writing, let us tell you all about Lindsey, who is one-half of the emergency rescue team and is also the co-founder of Practical Home with her sister Kirsten.</p><h3><strong>Lindsey Uselding On HGTV’s Renovation 911</strong></h3><p>In this very HGTV series based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Lindsey and her sister are documented as they bring expertise and humor to difficult situations while rescuing homes destroyed by natural disasters.</p><p>Lindsey left her corporate job at Target to work at her own Ungerman, and it did so great. And from here, she decided to leap into television together with her sister Kirsten. And so Renovation 911 happened. This is their first time doing this kind of show.</p><p>All through the season, Lindsey, together with her sister, will be seen assisting families affected by fire, crashes, floods, fallen trees, and other natural catastrophes. At one point in the show, tables will turn and one sister will become the client after her own home is ruined by a hail storm. Whose that would be? We will have to wait of course!</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Lindsey Uselding Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Lindsey Uselding reportedly had $1 million and plus net worth as of March 2023.</p><p>As of 5 December 2022 until present, she has been the co-founder at Practical Home in&nbsp;home safety maintenance and design service in Minneapolis, Minnesota.</p><p>Also, as of 5 January 2019 until present, Lindsey has been the owner/vice president at Ungerman, Inc.</p><p>On her LinkedIn, Lindsey goes on to write that she is an experienced business operations manager with a demonstrated history of working in the consumer services industry.</p><p>If you also need to know, she finished her schooling at a private high school and then studied for a BBA in Human Resources, Management, followed by Marketing at the Univerisity of Wisconsin-Madison.</p><h3><strong>Lindsey Uselding Age</strong></h3><p>Lindsey J Uselding was born in 1980. So, she turned 43 years old in 2023.</p><h3><strong>Lindsey Uselding Family</strong></h3><p>It is said Lindsey had an idyllic childhood as she grew up surrounded by her family.</p><p>Her mother is Joan Brinkman of Minneapolis, Minnesota, a former alum of the University of St. Thomas and Hamline University. Her IG @joancbrinkman, also tells us that she turned 70 years old in June 2022.</p><p>Then we have Theodore “Ted” M Brinkman, Lindsey’s Roseville, Minnesota-born dad. He turned 71 years old in December 2022. He had first asked Lindsey to join the family business (Ungerman Construction Company). She was unsure but even then promised him to take their business to a new level and this series Renovation 911 documents her helping with that motive, also joined by her sister.</p><p>Lindsey’s dad back in the day went to Minot State University and Kellogg High School.</p><p>Speaking of Lindsey’s sister and work partner <a href=#>Kirsten Brinkman Meehan</a>, she is the youngest of the two by three years. She has been married to her husband Ted Meehan for the past 14 years. And together they have two kids, a daughter named Fin and a son named Liam.</p><p>Before taking on her position in the family business, Kirsten worked as a high school sprint coach at Edina High School for 4 years.</p><h3><strong>Is Lindsey Uselding Married?</strong></h3><p>Yes. Lindsey Uselding has been married, and for quite some time. Her husband is <a href=#>Nathaniel “Nate” Uselding</a>, a second-grade teacher at Delano Elementary who turned 45 in November 2022. On LinkedIn, he also mentioned getting his MEd in Learning Design and Technology from Saint Mary’s University in 2017.</p><p>We don’t know when they got married. But, clearly, they are still very much in love. Also, every year the day June 20th marks the couple’s anniversary. On this day last year, Nate took to his IG <a href=#>@nate_uselding</a>, to shout out to the world that Lindsey is the love of his life and that he can not imagine a day without her. He said she is the best and thanked her for making him who he is, and for being an amazing wife and mother.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/lindsey-uselding-bio-age-net-worth-hgtv-renovation-911-2023-1-263x300.jpg><p>Lindsey and her husband share two beautiful daughters Alivia Jade Uselding (on IG <a href=#>@alivia_uselding</a>) and Braylin Uselding (on IG <a href=#>@braylinuselding_</a>).</p><p>The one on the left in the picture, i.e., Alivia is into basketball and track & field.
