Learn about her age, birthday, and other related details. Moreover, we will also discuss her parent’s current relationship.</p><p>So, keep on scrolling to learn more about her and her parents.</p><h3><strong>Meet Ex Basketball Wives Star Brittish Williams Daughter, Dash Dior Gordon</strong></h3><p>Dash Dior Gordon was born to her parents Brittish Williams and Lorenzo Gordon. Brittish recently shared a picture of her daughter on her IG, and captioned it, “<span class="_aacl _aaco _aacu _aacx _aad7 _aade">I get up and do it every day for you! @dashdiorg”.</span></p><p>In June 2022, Brittish posted a selfie and wrote, “Such a cool kid! Love you to the moon and back @dashdiorg”. The mother-daughter duo also spent Valentine’s Day together and Brittish boasted that she is the funniest. Two of them definitely share a strong bond with each other.</p><p>Brittish recently made headlines after losing a profitable Savage x Fenty deal. According to RadarOnline, Brittish claimed that the bulky court-ordered GPS device on her ankle bracelet monitoring device cost her a huge deal.</p><p>In September 2021, the Federal fraud indictment charges came down on Williams by a federal grand jury for the fraudulent use of a Social Security number, four charges of bank fraud, three charges of making false statements to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), three charges of wire fraud, and three charges of aggravated identity theft. The charges total five felonies, the&nbsp;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>reports</a>.</p><p>Brittish was given a curfew and told to wear an electronic monitoring device by the judge. She argued that the gadget is “significantly hampering her career opportunities and preventing her from being as successful and productive as she might otherwise be”.</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Her attorney </span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>claims the ankle monitor</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true> prohibits the producers from fully employing her in the series.</span></p><p><span>“The producers of the show do not want the ankle monitor to be visible,” he wrote. </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“This creates stark limitations on the outfits and costuming that Ms. Williams can utilize. Ms. Williams does not engage in work for which she gets to choose her own outfits and clothes”.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Brittish alleged that she lost out on a partnership deal with </span>Rihanna’s<span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;Savage X Fenty lingerie company that forfeited a partnership deal with her because her ankle bracelet would be visible in photos,&nbsp;Radar Online reported.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The court document read, “This lost opportunity cost Ms. Williams at least $30,000 with additional payments that would have been available for Instagram appearances and posts”.</span></p><h3><strong>Dash Dior Gordon Father</strong></h3><p>Everyone knows Brittish from VH1’s Basketball Wives. She joined the show in season 3 when the show branched out to Los Angeles. She landed a spot on the show after getting dating pro-basketball star Lorenzo Gordon. Lorenzo then proposed to her on the season 3 reunion of the show.</p><p>Lorenzo Gordon then became father to Dash Dior Gordon.</p><p>But like most relationships, they also had the same problem, unfaithfulness. The relationship problem surfaced not long after, within a year of getting engaged. Brittish then broke up with Lorenzo on his birthday after finding out he had cheated on her while overseas.</p><p>The couple tried to work on their relationship by appearing on Marriage Boot&nbsp;Camp: Reality Stars. But their relationship took a turn for the worst. Despite all the efforts, they eventually became estranged after 2020. It has been more than two years since they stopped featuring on each other’s socials.</p><p>But, whether it is to vent the pain she feels or the relevance she sought, Brittish chose to call out her ex Lorenzo on social media. She voiced, “Public service announcement, my baby daddy is a sucker, let’s make that very clear”. She ranted further saying, “I’m not talking to you, I’m not bothering you. I changed my number almost two months ago. You can’t even contact me, what are we talking about?”.</p><p>The fight brought into light the details of unpaid child support, but she shared everything in a cryptic manner. So, it remains unclear what caused Brittish to go berserk on the internet.</p><p>As for Gordon, his IG bio shares that he has been a professional basketball player for 14 years. He is currently the CEO of The Sweat Box STL. He is working as a personal trainer who also advises meal plans for his clients. Born on 16 May 1983, he is 39 years old in 2022.</p><p>He professionally played one season for Illinois State Redbirds in NCAA.</p><p>Then, he played in the international leagues in Germany, Turkey, Italy, Israel, and Argentina. He retired professionally in 2017 after playing three seasons with Ramat Hasharon.</p><p>Gordon also features her daughter on his IG occasionally.</p><h3><strong>Dash Dior Gordon Age</strong></h3><p>In May 2022, Dash Dior Gordon turned 4 years old. So, May 2018 is the year she was born.</p><p>On her 3rd birthday, Brittish wished her, “Happy birthday baby I love you! You gave me purpose. You introduced me to a love I will forever be thankful for You are smart, beautiful, funny, loving, a whole freaking mood! I’m so proud to call you my child! I’m so proud to be your mom!
