Age And Biography</h2><p>Tayler was born on<strong> August 19, 1997,</strong> in Alvarado, Texas, and spent most of his childhood there. He is<strong> 26 years old</strong>. Although details of his youth are largely unknown, he is the youngest of three siblings, with an older brother and an older adopted sister, but nothing about them has been made public, despite the interest of his many fans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tayler1.jpg><h2>Tayler Holder Education</h2><p>In terms of education, Tayler moved to Los Angeles, California, after graduation to pursue his dreams of becoming a singer and actor. There, he began to build his online presence on social media, and his content quickly gained a large following.</p><h2>Tayler Holder Profession</h2><p>Aside from his Instagram modeling, funny Tik-Tok videos, and YouTube lifestyle vlogging, Tayler has also released a couple of singles – ‘Who I Am’ and ‘Fallback’ – as well as a Christmas single with Casey Bear.</p><h2>Who Has Tayler Holder Dated? Relationship And Affairs</h2><p>Fans are more interested in the juicy details of the young influencer’s romantic interests than they are in the young influencer’s early life. Tayler has a history with some of the top social media influencers, owing to her reputation as one of the sexiest and most attractive influencers on Tik-Tok and Instagram.</p><p>Tayler has not been shy about his romances, as a couple of Holder’s relationships played out in front of all his fans. Furthermore, recent rumors suggest that the 23-year-old influencer is dating American fitness model Sommer Ray.</p><p>Tayler has known American gymnast and dancer Kelianne Stankus for years, and she recently became a TikTok content creator. While Kelianne is new to social media, she has previous experience with public exposure, as she made a name for herself in the competitive world of gymnastics, winning a gold medal at the 2005 Freedom Cup gymnastics event, and is a familiar name to many who follow the sport.</p><p>Despite their claims to be good friends, many of Tayler and Kelianne’s fans have long suspected that their friendship is based on a deeper bond than the two are willing to admit.</p><p>Tayler and Kelianne kissed in front of the camera in a 2017 video that went viral, but it appeared to be nothing more than a publicity stunt. They remained friends after the video’s release, but in a video posted three years later, in 2020, they elaborated on the stunt. This time, they pretended to be in a relationship, but Kelianne claims there was more to it than just an act.</p><p>Kelianne revealed that they kept their relationship a secret, despite the fact that it began as a friendship.</p><p>Things ended bitterly, as Stankus stated that their relationship ended because they began seeing other people, but it was for the better, according to her. She claimed that the relationship was extremely confusing and to some extent toxic and that it would have ended sooner or later, with Kelianne appearing to be relieved that it did.</p><p>Tayler and Kelianne appear to have put their differences aside and re-established a good friendship since their break-up. Both have since moved on to new relationships.</p><p>Kelianne is rumored to be dating model Chase Mattson, while Tayler has begun dating several other women.</p><p>Because Tayler and Kelianne’s relationship is so private, it’s difficult to pinpoint a specific time frame for their romance. It becomes even more difficult to pinpoint the specific romances that followed, particularly Tayler’s alleged relationship with Logan Paul’s Team Ten member, Kaylyn Slevin.</p><p>While many Hype House members are known for dirty, attention-seeking tactics such as faking relationships, cheating, flirting with people in other relationships, and more, most fans believe Holder is the most honest member.</p><p>Given the mystery surrounding his relationship with the young actress Kaylyn, it appears that the Instagram model succumbed to the Hype. According to some sources, Kaylyn and Tayler dated briefly in 2019, while others claim there is no reliable evidence to confirm the relationship.</p><p>The only evidence that Tayler and Slevin had a relationship is a video posted on Holder’s YouTube channel in which he breaks the sad news to his fans about their alleged break-up. He also goes into detail about the reason for their split, explaining that Kaylyn’s hectic schedule prevented her from giving Holder the attention he allegedly deserves.</p><p>Tayler admits in the video that he and Kaylyn’s friendship will continue, and he lavishes her with compliments.<br>Holder previously expressed interest in another girl, Logan Paul’s former assistant and Instagram hottie, Ayla Woodruff, before his relationship with Kaylyn became public. He even went so far as to ask her out on camera, but nothing came of it. Tayler then had a fictitious relationship with fellow Hype House member Dixie D’Amelio. The two appeared in each other’s Tik-Tok videos on a regular basis, but never confirmed their relationship, though it did get their fans excited and anticipating that they would eventually reveal the truth.</p><p>Unfortunately, it appeared to be yet another dirty stunt by the Hype crew.</p><h2>More On Relationship</h2><p>In the most recent developments, Dixie and her current boyfriend, Noah Beck, are being accused of faking a relationship.</p><p>Tayler’s only undisputed relationship in his past romances was an on-again, off-again affair with model Sommer Ray. It’s unclear when the two first met, but their first public connection was on May 19, 2020. Tayler shared a Snapchat conversation he had with Sommer, and Sommer responded with a dancing Tik-Tok in Tayler’s company the next day.</p><p>In the days that followed, the two appeared together more frequently, raising the possibility of a romantic relationship between them.</p><p>Tayler and Sommer’s recent romantic fallout, during which they unfollowed each other, was the topic of discussion on the YouTube series ‘TeaTok’ on June 16. This was in response to Ray’s Tweet, in which she cryptically told someone, most likely Tayler, that his apology needed to be as big as his disrespect.</p><p>However, not long after their alleged first break-up, the couple dined together, but when asked about their relationship, they claimed to be just friends.</p><p>Then, toward the end of June, they resumed TikToking together, and it appeared as if their relationship was back on track and sweeter than ever.</p><p>Tayler, on the other hand, perplexed everyone on July 10 when he was spotted on a dinner date with someone other than Sommer. Charly Jordan, a social media model, and influencer, was the lady in question. Sommer appeared to have forgotten who he was after Tayler’s not-so-secret date.</p><h2>Sommer Simply Asked Who Tayler Was When Questioned By The Media.</h2><p>Tayler confirmed that he and Sommer had called it quits on their relationship for the final time in a series of cryptic, almost melancholy messages on social media. While many of his fans sympathized with him, others expressed their suspicions, accusing him of cheating on Sommer.</p><p>Tayler quickly responded by posting videos on his social media accounts in which he denied the claims made by fans, claiming that he did not cheat on Sommer and that she was the one who blocked him on social media.</p><p>Fans, however, are still speculating about the allegations, especially now that Tayler and Charly have made their relationship public. Tayler urged his fans not to harass his new girlfriend and bring negativity into his life in the same video, titled “a message to his ex-.”</p><p>Despite Tayler’s efforts, it appears that his fans aren’t fond of his latest romance. Nonetheless, Tayler and Charly appear unconcerned about the mockery, as they continue to post sweet and romantic pictures on their social media accounts.</p><p>For the time being, fans are waiting to see if there is any more drama in Taylor Holder’s dating history.</p><h2>Tayler Holder’s Net Worth</h2><p><strong>Tayler Holder’s net worth is about $2 million as of November 2023.</strong></p><h2>Facts</h2><li>He is active on social media.</li><li>He has dated a lot of girls.</li><li>Tayler loves cookies.</li><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Social influencer</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGirmrGcmr9utM6lm56qXw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./noorin-sha.html>&#171;&nbsp;Noorin Sha Net Worth, Bio, Career, In Relation, Age, Facts</a>
