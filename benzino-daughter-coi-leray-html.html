Here is everything you need to know about it.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Benzino and His Daughter Coi Leray's Feud&nbsp;</h2><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Benzino and Leray's beef</a>&nbsp;blasted for the entire internet to see in early 2021. The father-daughter duo&nbsp;took their turbulent relationship online and blamed each other for their past actions.&nbsp;</p><p>Leray has been vocal about her father not having her back ever since she came to the limelight. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">She told Paper Magazine</a> in 2019 that she was raised by her brothers and mother, not Benzino.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Benzino was the co-owner&nbsp;of the hip-hop magazine named The Source. The magazine was founded in 1988 and is currently one of the longest-running magazines in the entertainment industry.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Leray implied that after Benzino was done with the hip-hop industry, it severed the relationship between him and her mother. Soon after that, Benzino and Leray's mother parted ways.&nbsp;</p><p>She moved in with her mother, where the money used to be an issue. To overcome it, she had to work from a young age and make a name for herself.&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless, it appears as if the father-daughter duo had a civil relationship. In addition, Benzino's YouTube channel helped her and her brother take a step towards a music career.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In 2020, Leray shared a now-deleted Instagram post with Chavo and Benzino with a caption, "my world."</p><p>She even referred to her father's work ethic as her inspiration on <a href=# rel=follow>Adam22</a>'s No Jumper podcast.&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless, she was sure that her father's legacy would not be behind her success in the music industry. The beef between Benizo and his daughter escalated after Leray released a song with Lil Durk named 'No More Parties.' <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>She took a shot at her father, claiming that Benzino had let her down.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm too busy getting this money counting cheddar/My daddy let me down, but I promise you I won't let up/I wanna say f***&nbsp;that man, but that s***&nbsp;won't make me better.</p><p>After Benzino realized what his daughter had said, he took to Instagram to claim that nobody would tarnish his image like this. He said he understood&nbsp;Leray's hardship but said he was there for her no matter what.</p><p>Benzino clarified in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram Live with Queenzflip</a> that Leray was raised in a mansion and "had everything she asked for." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>He even went on to say that his other kids would never say things like she did.&nbsp;</p><p>According to him, Leray got everything she asked for, and he was present in her childhood. He added he was with her every vacation, including Spring Break, Christmas, and Thanksgiving.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Leray requested her daughter to back off, but Leray did the opposite. She said she was embarrassed to be his daughter in an Instagram live.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>She accused Benzino of not caring for her and said they had a phone conversation where she told him she needed him. However, Benzino allegedly said she should have been a boy and not a girl.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The back and forth continued for a while until Leray apologized via Twitter. She tweeted that she loved her dad&nbsp;"forever and always."</p><p>Initially, Benzino was not too keen on making amends, but currently, the pair seem to be on good terms.</p><p>In April 2021, he claimed that the drama between him and his daughter was over.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In May 2021, he boasted he was proud of his&nbsp;son and daughter for being in the music industry and getting major record deals.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Therefore, it seems like the feud is over once and for all.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJqVo8equs5mm5qtl53Bpr6MnKaiZZyav6LFjaGrpqQ%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./taiwan-little-league-world-series-team-led-by-star-fan-chen-jun.html>&#171;&nbsp;Taiwan Little League World Series team led by star Fan Chen-Jun</a>
