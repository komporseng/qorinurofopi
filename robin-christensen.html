Robin had previously lost her father on the night of January 27, 1993. Her father died in his sleep in a Paris hotel from congestive heart failure. On the morning of January 28, however, a chauffeur discovered him. Robin’s father had traveled to Paris to attend her grandfather’s funeral.</p><p>In addition, Robin Christensen had little contact with her father. She’d only ever seen him five times in her life.
