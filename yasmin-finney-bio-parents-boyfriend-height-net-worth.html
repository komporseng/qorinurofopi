Talking to media outlets recently, she said she feels blessed to be telling a “positive” trans story.</p><p>So with this confidence and Elle’s vulnerability, shyness, and ability to be unapologetically herself, Yasmin’s portrayal is sure to become a fan favorite.</p><h3><strong>Is Yasmin Finney A Transgender Woman?</strong></h3><p>Yas min Finney is openly a transgender woman.

In several of her TikTok videos, she hinted at the fact that she has very turbulent relationships with many people in her family. And that is because they are according to her, transphobic. Then, in another such video, she bluntly shared that she has been thriving without them.</p><h3><strong>Yasmin Finney Height</strong></h3><p>Yasmin Finney herself confirmed via tweet that on 1 March 2022 that her height is 5′ 11″.

She opened up that she has high expectations of what she wants to be when she is older. For now, though, she has earned work with Manchester’s leading model agency Nemesis Models.</p><p>And of course now with her Netflix debut, Yasmin would also love to do on-screen roles that are really represented as a Black trans woman.
