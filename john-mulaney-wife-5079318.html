Mulaney</a>&nbsp;</strong>is one of the most popular comedians working today. While he worked for years behind the scenes as a writer on&nbsp;Saturday Night Live,&nbsp;the comic, 40, rose to fame after his debut comedy special&nbsp;New In Town&nbsp;was released. His standup specials&nbsp;The Comeback Kid&nbsp;and&nbsp;Kid Gorgeous&nbsp;have garnered him a huge audience. Besides his comedy specials, he’s also lent his voice to animated projects like&nbsp;Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse&nbsp;and the series&nbsp;Big Mouth. Not only that but he’s also returned to SNL&nbsp;to host 5 times, making him one of few to host the comedy institution so many times.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>One of the most frequent subjects of his comedy for years was his relationship with his then-wife&nbsp;<strong>Anna Marie Tendler,&nbsp;</strong>37, to who he was wed from 2014 until they separated in 2021. Shortly after their split was announced, it was revealed that John was dating actress <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Olivia Munn,</a>&nbsp;</strong>42, and the pair have an adorable son together.

John joked that he needed to come up with a good excuse to leave the house to pick out an engagement ring. He said he told her that he was going to grab lunch with the&nbsp;Crashing&nbsp;star. He said that he asked Pete not to tweet that they weren’t getting lunch together, but Pete posted a photo about doing a podcast on Instagram. “In fairness to Pete, I said, ‘Don’t tweet anything,'” he quipped.</p><h2>John & Anna got married in 2014</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>The couple tied the knot in July 2014 in a ceremony in Boiceville, New York. Fellow comic <strong>Dan Levy&nbsp;</strong>said the ceremony, as John revealed in his 2015 special&nbsp;The Comeback Kid.&nbsp;In the early years of their marriage, John joked about how happy he was to finally call Anna his wife. “Being married is so nice. I never knew relationships were supposed to make you feel better about yourself,” he said in&nbsp;The Comeback Kid.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>While the pair never had kids, they did own a French bulldog, <strong>Petunia,&nbsp;</strong>who John also included in his act. The comedian even included the pup in the sketch opening&nbsp;The Comeback Kid.&nbsp;During a joke about buying a home, John also said that the pair <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>didn’t want kids</a> in the special. Since the split, Anna has revealed that she<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> froze her eggs</a> in a January 2022 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Harper’s Bazaar.</a>&nbsp;She explained that she “always held partnership above having kids.”</p><h2>Anna is an artist</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>John’s first wife was an artist. Early in her career, Anna was a hairstylist and makeup artist, but she eventually transitioned into other mediums. She works in “photography, textiles, drawing, painting and interior design,” according to her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>website</a>. Following her split from the&nbsp;Kid Gorgeous&nbsp;comic, some of her photographic art has garnered a huge audience as works like “Dinner In March” and other pieces from her Rooms in the First House&nbsp;series appeared to reference her relationship and split from John. She often shares her art on her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>.</p><h2>John talked about Anna in his comedy specials</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>John made a reference to Anna in his 2012 special&nbsp;New In Town,&nbsp;before they were married. After the pair tied the knot, she became a regular staple of his comedy. Aside from discussing their relationship in The Comeback Kid, he also joked about Anna in his 2017 special Kid Gorgeous.&nbsp;He revealed that he’d asked his wife’s permission before he made fun of her in his act. He joked about how different their personalities are while sharing stories about going to Best Buy and speaking about their different religious upbringings. Anna also made a cameo in his&nbsp;John Mulaney And The Sack Lunch Bunch&nbsp;special in 2019.</p><h2>John & Anna broke up in 2021</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>After John’s second stint in rehab, which began in December 2020, it was announced that John and Anna had <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>separated in May 2021.</a> He <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>filed for divorce</a> in July 2021, and the divorce was finalized in January 2022. After the split, Anna opened up about the heartache and diving into the “Rooms in the First House” series in the Harper’s Bazaar&nbsp;profile. “Everything that has transpired has been totally shocking and I think surreal,” she said. “I had a lot of bad days and medium days. I wouldn’t say I had any good days until the summer.”</p><h2>Who Is John Mulaney Dating Now?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/John-Mulaney-Marriage-Evergreen-embed-2-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>Shortly after the split from Anna, it was revealed that John was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>dating actress</a> Olivia Munn.
