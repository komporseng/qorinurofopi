Her testimony chronicled the actions former President Trump took on the day of the violent Capitol attack.</p><p>She served as an aide to former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. She testified that Trump had wanted the Ellipse to be fully packed with supporters for his speech on Jan. 6. Some of them watching from a distance in order to avoid going through metal detectors and surrendering their weapons hampered that.</p><h3><strong>Who Is Cassidy Hutchinson?</strong></h3><p>On 28 June 2022, Cassidy Hutchinson also testified to Trump’s reaction to his limousine on January 6. She testified that Tony Ornato, then-White House deputy chief of staff for operations, relayed to her later that day that the former president became enraged when Secret Service refused to take him to the Capitol and instead insisted that they return to the White House.</p><p>Cassidy added that Ornato told her that Trump had attempted to grab the wheel of the vehicle and then to grab the agent himself.</p><p>The testimony indicated that Trump was aware that the crowds were armed. He then instructed these armed crowd to march to the Capitol to “fight like hell” against certifying the 2020 election results. She also quoted her former boss saying that Trump “doesn’t want to do anything” about calls for violence against then-Vice President Mike Pence.</p><p>She recalled Mark saying, “He thinks Mike deserves it”.</p><p>People were divided after Cassidy Hutchinson’s testimony.</p><p>David French, an editor for The Dispatch, praised Cassidy for “the most extraordinary congressional testimony I’ve ever seen”. He wrote, “Hutchinson’s sworn testimony closes a gap in the criminal case against Trump, and Trump is closer to a credible prosecution than ever before”.</p><p>Trump in response to Cassidy’s testimony said that he “hardly know[s]” her. He made negative remarks against her saying her “a total phony and ‘leaker'”. He added that he “didn’t want or request that we make room for people with guns to watch my speech” and called her testimony “fake” and “sick”.</p><p>In addition, Cassidy has also become the target of online conspiracy theorist “Q” who posed absurd and illogical questions against Cassidy Hutchinson and her testimony regarding the January 6 Capitol Hill Riot.</p><h3><strong>Is Cassidy Hutchinson Dating Anyone?</strong></h3><p>Ever since the testimony January 6 testimony of Cassidy Hutchinson, everybody is interested to learn more about her life beyond what meets the eye. Her career was an open book and she is also on LinkedIn, but what about her personal life. Is she dating someone today?</p><p>Cassidy is a very attractive 26-year-old young lady. Her father believes that she inherited her good looks, her smartness & personality, and her hardworking nature all from her mother. Indeed, she is truly blessed with all of that. The last time we know someone who turned heads and earned overnight fame in just a matter of hours/days was <a href=#>Camille Vasquez.</a></p><p>The only difference is everyone unanimously hailed Camille as a queen. While in the case of Cassidy, the crowds are split. Trump supporters are comparing her to Amber Heard and even dubbed her “Amber Heard 2.0”.</p><p>Nevertheless, she spoke fearlessly on the court and displayed a strong personality which earned her praise from the other half. But, we assure you that she doesn’t seem to be on any social media platforms.</p><p>A well-accomplished, smart, and beautiful woman at the start of her career, she attracts a lot of men looking forward to dating her. However, she keeps her dating life under wraps and there is nothing to explore about her current dating life or relationship status.</p><h3><strong>Cassidy Hutchinson Dating History</strong></h3><p>As stated earlier, Cassidy Hutchinson is private about her current dating life. And same applies to her past dating life. She chooses to remain away from social media. Hence, there isn’t much to go on with to unravel details about her dating history. But, as a 26-year-old beautiful and smart, we can imagine men approaching her all the time. And she has dated at least once we assume.</p><p>One fine example of that is the <a href=#>January 2020 post</a> on Cassidy’s father Richard’s Facebook. One follower commented on Richard’s post and asked, “Single? You could be my father-in-law!”</p><p>Richard, as a response, wrote to him in the comment, “she is married with 12 children;))))) SORRY”.</p><p>So, we could see that men do craving her attention, even on her father’s social media. Conclusively, so we could only imagine what it is like for her in real life when it comes to dating.</p><h3><strong>Cassidy Hutchinson Loved Ones</strong></h3><p>We don’t have much about Cassidy Hutchoson’s dating life. But we know that she has plenty of loved ones in her life. They are her parents <a href=#>Richard Hutchinson</a> and <a href=#>Angela Hutchinson</a>, and her brother <a href=#>Jack Hutchinson.</a></p><p>They are not only her loved ones but her biggest supporters and cheers.
